# Matching an Email

Today, I will be teaching you a bit about matching an email.

## Summary

Matching an email to make sure the email is correct is what we were be learning. There are a several table of contents that express multiple regex components. I have defined each one to help grab a better understanding of them.

## Table of Contents

- [Anchors](#anchors)
- [Quantifiers](#quantifiers)
- [Grouping Constructs](#grouping-constructs)
- [Bracket Expressions](#bracket-expressions)
- [Character Classes](#character-classes)
- [The OR Operator](#the-or-operator)
- [Flags](#flags)
- [Character Escapes](#character-escapes)

## Regex Components

### Anchors

Anchors are regex tokens that don't match any characters but that say or assert something about the string or the matching process. In this case, ^ asserts position at start of the string.

### Quantifiers

Quantifiers specify how many instances of a character, group, or character class must be present in the input for a match to be found. This can be shown in the symbols + and {2,6}.

### Grouping Constructs

Grouping constructs delineate the subexpressions of a regular expression and capture the substrings of an input string. There are a total of 3. It defined by using '()'.

### Bracket Expressions

A bracket expression is either a matching list expression or a non-matching list expression. It consists of one or more expressions: ordinary characters, collating elements, collating symbols, equivalence classes, character classes, or range expressions.

### Character Classes

In the context of regular expressions, a character class is a set of characters enclosed within square brackets. It specifies the characters that will successfully match a single character from a given input string. In this case, it is expressed using '[]'.

### The OR Operator

Operator (logical OR) to match characters or expression of either the left or right of the | operator. In the regex, there are no OR operators.

### Flags

A regular expression consists of a pattern and optional flags: g , i , m , u , s , y. In this case, it is defined using the characters; a,z, and d.

### Character Escapes

Characer escapes are mostly known as single backslash. In this case, it is called meta escapes and the symbols were ^ and $.
